# sqlZoo

These are answers to SQL Zoo's lessons 1 - 9, including the +/- lessons in that range. 

In case anyone is out there, trying to complete these problem sets and runs into similar problems, I completed the exercises on 5/1/2023. As of today, the MySQL option does not work for any problem. 

The answers found here were completed (mostly) using Microsoft SQL. Mostly because in some cases the Microsoft option wasn't working but the PostgreSQL option was. Those problems are labeled. 

In case you are thinking: why not just use PostgreSQL then? Know that for many problems, PostgreSQL would not recognize the table names given or other errors were thrown.
